cargo is Rustâ€™s package manager and build system. It handles the building of
your code and its dependencies

If we had to create the same hello world project using cargo, we would do
following (go to the rust_projects directory from terminal/Command
Prompt):
$ cargo new hello_world_cargo
$ cd hello_world_cargo

Building and running with cargo
In order to build and run our program, we can use the cargo run command:
$ cargo run
