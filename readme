# Basic Understanding

-> cargo is Rustâ€™s package manager and build system. It handles the building of
your code and its dependencies

-> If we had to create project using cargo, we would do
following (go to the rust_projects directory from terminal/Command
Prompt):
$ cargo new project_name
$ cd project_name

-> Building and running with cargo
In order to build and run program, we can use the cargo run command:
$ cargo run

-> "cargo.toml" file is just like package.json in other projects

-> project_name.exe is the actual machine code after compilation of code in \target\debug\project_name.exe

-> cargo run --release is used for generating optimazed code while deploying in production
